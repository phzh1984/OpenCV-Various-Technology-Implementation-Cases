# OpenCV Image Processing Techniques


Introduction

This repository showcases various image processing techniques implemented using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library). OpenCV is an open-source library extensively used for computer vision and machine learning applications. Here, we delve into multiple image processing concepts, explaining their functionality and providing code samples for each technique.

Description

This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing diverse image processing methods available in OpenCV. From fundamental operations such as image resizing, thresholding, and edge detection to advanced techniques including contour analysis, line detection, and background subtraction, each technology is explained with code samples and practical demonstrations.
